        me1: "Hey, I’m Karan 👋 — a curious mind who loves turning ambitious ideas into software that actually works (and scales). Whether it’s building decentralized platforms, AI-powered assistants, or full-stack apps, I enjoy the thrill of solving tough problems and making technology feel effortless for people who use it.",

        me2: "I’ve dabbled in quite a lot — from crafting a storage platform that refuses to go down (99.9% uptime!), to creating an AI email sidekick that slashes reply times by 85% 🚀, to leading hackathon teams where sleepless nights somehow turned into award-winning projects. Along the way, I’ve picked up skills in Java Spring Boot, React, Solidity, PostgreSQL, and more… but honestly, what excites me most is seeing something I built spark real impact.",

        me3: "Beyond my projects, I bring a strong foundation in problem-solving, demonstrated through a LeetCode Knight⚔️ rank (Rating - 1870+, among top 5% globally), 2⭐ at Codechef and over 1200+ coding challenges solved across platforms. With experience spanning internships, hackathons, and projects, I thrive in collaborative environments where innovation meets execution. I believe tech is about people — connecting, empowering, and making life a little smoother. So if you’re working on something exciting (or just love geeking out about great code), I’d love to connect.",
