Whether it‚Äôs building decentralized platforms, AI-powered assistants, or full-stack apps, I enjoy the thrill of solving tough problems and making technology feel effortless for people who use it.",

        me2: "I‚Äôve dabbled in quite a lot ‚Äî from crafting a storage platform that refuses to go down (99.9% uptime!), to creating an AI email sidekick that slashes reply times by 85% üöÄ, to leading hackathon teams where sleepless nights somehow turned into award-winning projects. Along the way, I‚Äôve picked up skills in Java Spring Boot, React, Solidity, PostgreSQL, and more‚Ä¶ but honestly, what excites me most is seeing something I built spark real impact.",

        me3: "Beyond my projects, I bring a strong foundation in problem-solving, demonstrated through a LeetCode Knight‚öîÔ∏è rank (top 10% globally), 2‚≠ê at Codechef and over 1000+ coding challenges solved across platforms. With experience spanning internships, hackathons, and projects, I thrive in collaborative environments where innovation meets execution. I believe tech is about people ‚Äî connecting, empowering, and making life a little smoother. So if you‚Äôre working on something exciting (or just love geeking out about great code), I‚Äôd love to connect.",
